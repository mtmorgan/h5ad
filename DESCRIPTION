Description: The 'h5ad' data file format is used to represent bulk-
    and especially single-cell sequencing data. It uses the 'hdf5'
    file format, so is accessible from multiple programming
    languages. This package provides facilities for discovering the
    content of an 'h5ad' file, as well as for selectively importing
    components fo the file (e.g., UMAP embeddings) into R. The
    functionality does *not* rely on Python, insteading parsing the
    h5ad file using functionality from the 'rhdf5'
    package. Alternatives include the 'anndata' (parsing to
    SingleCellExperiment using Python via the 'reticulate' package)
    and 'zellkonverter' (parsing to SingleCellExperiment using either
    native R or Python functionality).
